# Desktop-Bobrtc
This repository contains scripts that will use a program called nativefier to create a BobRTC desktop app that will run without the use of a web browser.
At the moment, I am currently working on the Linux Script and then will move onto the Windows Script (and maybe the Mac Script afterwards)
If you have problems or need assistance, you can dm/pm me on Discord at CutThroat#8601
